Clear out Live Data in Snowflake/Segmentation

# 1. Question assumptions
* What data are we talking about?
    * Any metrics associated with live stream events

* What is the date range of metrics we are clearing out?
    * The bug in the player was fixed on Nov 2, so anything before then

* When did the problem start?
    * It's been a problem since we launched the service in Februrary
    
* Where does the bug originate?
    * There was an issue in the ping plugin that didn't instantiate the correct object for bookkeeping
    
* Where might have this data cascaded to?
    * It is definitely wrong in snowflake's play sessions, preaggregates, and mongo.
        * We are not concerned with fixing Mongo because we have to deprecate it
    * It is wrong in video slices, but that's already wrong for live engagement so that is out of scope
        * Engagement is wrong in live streams because it's difficult to gauge the total length while users are watching
    * It might be wrong in usage in for plays, ad impressions, bytes streamed.
        * plays and ad impressions might be wrong. Are we concerned with this?
        
* What metrics do we want to NULL out?
    * Figure it out!
    
* How are we going to modify pre-aggregates?
    * We need a list of media_ids which were NULLed out and we can update those media_id's in preaggregates

# 2. Brute force approach
1. Figure out which metrics we want to NULL out
2. Run an update against snowflake for eastern_date <= '20171102' and EVENT_STREAM_TYPE='live' to fix play_sessions
3. Run a SELECT media_id query against play_sessions for eastern_date <='20171102' and EVENT_STREAM_TYPE='live'
to get a list of affected media_ids to use against preaggregates
4. Run an update query against preaggregates to NULL out the metrics identified in the first step

# 3. Runtime Analysis
Time: O(log N) for the SELECT media_id query because we are using eastern_date 
Space: O(log N) for the partitions loaded into memory because we are using eastern_date 

# 4. Can we optimize it?
Using a partition is as good as it gets without a straight lookup table. I'm happy with the solution. Perhaps we could do it in less queries?

# 5. Write it out
1. Figure out which metrics we want to NULL out
    * media_duration
    * num_pings
    * embeds
    * play_attempts
    * plays
    * completes
    * ad_requests
    * ad_errors
    * ad_starts
    * ad_impressions
    * ad_clicks
    * ad_skips
    * related_clicks
    * watched_duration
    * watched_pct
    * num_ad_breaks
    * avg_active_tab
    * avg_pct_viewable
    * avg_player_height
    * avg_player_width
    * first_frame
    * setup_duration
    * has_ad_block
    * is_autostart
    * num_domains
    * ad_completes
2. Run an update against snowflake for eastern_date <= '20171102' and EVENT_STREAM_TYPE='live' to fix play_sessions
    ```SQL
       UPDATE PRD_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.PLAY_SESSIONS
       SET    media_duration = NULL,
              num_pings = NULL,
              embeds = NULL,
              play_attempts = NULL,
              plays = NULL,
              completes = NULL,
              ad_requests = NULL,
              ad_errors = NULL,
              ad_starts = NULL,
              ad_impressions = NULL,
              ad_clicks = NULL,
              ad_skips = NULL,
              related_clicks = NULL,
              watched_duration = NULL,
              watched_pct = NULL,
              num_ad_breaks = NULL,
              avg_active_tab = NULL,
              avg_pct_viewable = NULL,
              avg_player_height = NULL,
              avg_player_width = NULL,
              first_frame = NULL,
              setup_duration = NULL,
              has_ad_block = NULL,
              is_autostart = NULL,
              num_domains = NULL,
              ad_completes = NULL
       WHERE  eastern_date < '2017-11-02'
       AND    stream_event_type = 'live';
        
    ```
3. Run a SELECT media_id query against play_sessions for eastern_date <'20171102' and EVENT_STREAM_TYPE='live'
to get a list of affected media_ids to use against preaggregates
    ```SQL
        SELECT media_id
        FROM   play_sessions
        WHERE  eastern_date < '2017-11-02'
        AND    stream_event_type = 'live';
        
    ```
4. Run an update query against preaggregates to NULL out the metrics identified in the first step
    ```sql
        UPDATE preaggregates_daily
        SET    ad_requests = NULL
               ad_impressions = NULL
               ad_clicks = NULL
               ad_skips = NULL
               ad_completes = NULL
               viewers = NULL
               embeds = NULL
               plays = NULL
               completes = NULL
               watched_duration = NULL
               quart1 = NULL
               quart2 = NULL
               quart3 = NULL
               quart4 = NULL
        WHERE  eastern_date < '2017-11-02'
        AND    media_id in ()
    ```

# 6. Go back and flesh out any simplifications
* How will you get the list of media_ids from step 3 into the query you run to update preaggregates in step 4?
    * I could do a listagg(media_id, '\',\'') on media_id
    * I could export it and format it in a text editor

# 7. Test/Follow up
* We can do a select count(*) on any of the steps to do sanity checks on the magnitude of the NULLing.

* Are we concerned with usage db with respect to plays or ad completes?

* What will we be doing to verify? How can we be satisfied with the results of these queries?
