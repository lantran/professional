# Runbook Leaderboard

## Motivation
Everyone is on Data Team Pagerduty schedule but the runbooks are not made for everyone
  * 14 people, 4 teams, 50 services, 455 monitors, no standards

## Solution
* Produce a monthly Leaderboard of services with runbooks that everyone can use
    * How can we reward top services?
* Proposed [Runbook template](https://jwplayer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INC/pages/107315391/Runbook+Template) that everyone can use
* Example Leader Board
