V1 Canned Report Endpoint for Segmentation V2

List of canned reports
Query parameters to be passed via URL
* Name
* Description
* Query

This can go in segmentation-api or analytics-api
+ what are the trade-offs of either option

*COMMUNICATE WITH PORTAL!*

#1. Resolve ambiguity
###### 1. Is there any existing documents about segmentation v2?
* [Yes, click here](https://jwplayer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AN/pages/70621721/Segmentation+V2) 

###### 2. What are some examples of pre-canned report names?
* What happened yesterday? 
* Where does my content perform best? 
* Are my viewers engaged?

###### 3. *What are the query parameters supposed to represent?*
The query parameters are supposed to represent how to fill out the UI in the segmentation page

###### 4. Should the response be as follows?
```
{'report_templates':
    [
        {'name':'What happened yesterday?', 
         'description':'A quick summary of events that happened yesterday', 
         'query': 'See below',
        }...
    ]
}
```

* query key should look like

###### 5. Should this go in Reporting API or Segmentation API?

*Reporting*

| Pros          | Cons          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Would go through the api gateway     | Need to redeploy reporting for changes to reporting if pre-canned reports changes which isn't reporting related |

*Segmentation*

| Pros          | Cons          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Since segmentation will eventually be just for the dashboard product, seems like the right place      | Would go through the proxy - something we want to deprecate |
| Reduce load on reporting API for non-reporting related information


###### 6. When you say communicate with portal, what exactly are you referring to?
* An API spec doc with the external, internal, request params, response codes, and response body

###### 7. How often will the pre-canned reports change?
* Not often, we can think of them as static

###### 8. Where will you store the list of pre-canned reports?
* In a file for now

##### 9. Who else other than the segmentation product might conceivably use the list of pre-canned reports?
* No.

#2. Example
[dashboard/segmentation] asks for "the list of canned reports" -> [api_gateway] "I don't know how but I know who does"
-> [segmentation_service/report_templates] "I give the same list back to everyone. There is nothing specific to you"

#3. Brute Force Solution
[] Add a class called CannedReport with a get method
[] Mount the class as an endpoint in /media/__init__.py
[] Add a static structure for detailing the metadata and data about each canned report
[] Add an endpoint that explains the response schema object for the schema key of the response

#4. Time and Space Analysis. Can it be done more optimally?
Time: O(1) for the get request
Space: O(n) where n in the number of canned reports

#5. Walk through your solution. Does it make sense?
Yes. 

I did overlook exposing a resource to explain the schema of the response object.

We should be good now. 

Update: Paul D said nobody actually hosts this. Provide an empty value for the schema key

#6. Implement it
[x] Add a class called CannedReport with a get method
[x] Mount the class as an endpoint in /media/__init__.py
[x] Add a static structure for detailing the metadata and data about each canned report
[-] Add an endpoint that explains the response schema object for the schema key of the response

#7. Test
The endpoint performs as I would expect. The order of the keys is not deterministic, but should they be?

#8. What did I learn?
* Can use the id_generator function for creating large lists as it forces python to create lists on demand instead of loading the entire list into memory at once

#9. Feedback
* [x] For complicated response objects in python
    - [x] define the response in a model 
    - [x] use the marshall to enforce it
* [x] Limit response to 5 reports
* [] Move the report templates to a different module/file
    - [x] create a folder called canned_reports in v2.lib.schema
    - [x] have one big file for all reports 
    - [] have one file per report 
* [x] Change report_templates to just reports
* [x] Change type of response to report
* [x] Fix the copy to reflect the doc
* [] Make a PR for API-Gateway
* [x] is_visible or is_active flag?
* [x] requires entitlements flag on a report
