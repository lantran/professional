#How to modify production data in a database
1. Come up with a plan of how you're going to modify it

2. Create a table like the production one you're going
to modify in another space.

3. Grab a sample of the data from the actual table and insert into your newly created table

4. Get a count of how many rows in the newly created table match those which you want to change in production
