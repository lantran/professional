# Software Engineering Organizational Theory
## Assumptions
* Each report takes 10% of the time of a people manager
* Each people manager wants to have 50% of their time to pursue non-people related growth
* Each person must have a well defined set of responsibilities, services, and initiatives
* About 100 engineers total

## Engineering Levels
|Level--- | Skills Dimensionality--- | Responsibilities | Services | Initiatives |
|---      |---                       |---               |---       |---          |

## How do we evaluate engineers?
* With a linear combination of effectivness of deliver of responsibilities, services and initiatives.

## What happens when engineers are doing well?

## What happens if engineers are *not* doing well?

## Who owns this evaluation?
