# How do I give feedback effectively?
### 1. Micro-Yes
###### Get buy-in
###### Reduce mystery
* Example A: Do you have 10 minutes to talk about your last email to Jill?
* Example B: Can I share some thoughts with you about how we've been working together?

### 2. Data Point
###### Focus on behavior, not person
###### Focus on data, not interpretation
###### No blur words
* Example A: __I've noticed that__ you replied to her email nine days after she sent it
* Example B: __I've noticed that__ you cancelled our last three 1-1s and haven't replied to the questions I sent last week

### 3. Impact Statement
###### Why does this matter?
###### Who is affected by it?
* Example A: __I mention it because__ she can't move forward without your reply, so it might delay her team.
* Example B: __I mention it because__ I'm thinking that you don't find my work important. I may be totally wrong, but I didn't want to keep my assumptions to myself.

### 4. Question
###### Check if they see it the same
###### Joint problem solve
###### Agree to an action plan
* Example A: What do you think our process should be moving forward?
* Example B: What are your thoughts? How do you see it?
