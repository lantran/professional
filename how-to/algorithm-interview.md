## Prompt
Could be anything, usually something that can be solved with code and validated

## Resolve Ambiguity
The interviewer generally wants to see how you handle incomplete specs

## Example
* Be sure the size of the example is non-trivial
* My rule of thumb is to have 7-8 items in more than one arrangment

## State brute force solution
* This demonstrates that you don't optimize pre-maturely and solidifies your understanding of the prompt
* Don't spend too much time getting here
| Solution Number | Description |
|---       |---          |
| 1        | Nested Loop | 
| 2        | Pre-compute cache |
...


## Time and Space Analysis
|Solution Number | Time | Space |
|--- | --- | --- |
| 1  | O(n^2) | O(1) | 
| 2  | O(n)   | O(n) |

* If not best conceivable run-time, keep iterating on your solution

## Code it
* In a language you're comfortable in
* I prefer Python as it's concise and time is a big factor in coding interviews

## Test it
* Validate that your code indeed solves the prompt stated
* Demonstrates you are careful and thorough
