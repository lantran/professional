## Prompt
Example: Design an e-commerce website that looks like everlane.com for RootNBundle.com
It could be basically anything though

## Resolve Ambiguity
The questions here will be depend on the prompt and what is specified and what is not

## Use Cases
|Feature | In-scope | Out-Of-Scope |
|--- |--- |--- | 
|1. Authentication | [x]    | |
|2. Logging        | [x]    | |
|3. Observability  | [x]    | |

You must always consider these 3, but depending on the prompt there will be others

## Constraints
|Feature | Request/sec | Users | 95% Latency | Consistency | Success Rate |
|---     |---          |---    |---          |---          |---           |
|1. Authentication  | | | | | | |
|2. Logging        | | | |  |  | |
|3. Observability  |  | | | | | |

For each of the use cases, fill in these 5 dimensions

# Abstract Design
Do this with block diagrams to demonstrate subsystems and their interactions

# Scale up your Abstract Design
Generally, the constrants of the problem will be changed and you'll have to find bottlenecks
