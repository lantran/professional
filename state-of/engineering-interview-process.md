# What's going well?
We are successfully getting non-referral engineers into positions to fulfill our needs as a business

# What's going poorly?
|Symptom|Possible Explanation|Proof?|
|-------|--------------------|------|
|We are losing candidates that we do give offers to based on interview process|[] |Anecdotal feedback from candidates|
|Interviewers are not punctual to interviews| We are not stressing the importance of punctuality to our interviewers |[] |
|Our on-site pass rate is too low| Our upstream screening processes are not as effective as they could be| [] |
|Interviewers are not sympathizing with the candidates| Interviewers may not have interviewed in a long time| []|
|We are not clear internally and externally about the prospective role| Poor communication between leads and HR| Anecdotal|
|Group round-ups encourage groupthink| [] | Anecdotal |
|The expectations of grading the interview are not clear| We haven't identified what we are grading on as an organization| Anecdotal|
|The on-site is too long| We've only appending interviews to the process, not removed any| []|


# How can we prove things are currently broken?
We as a group have identified three metrics we want to move:
1. Percentage people who accept offer that get them
2. Pass-through rate - of those people who come onsite, how many get offers? (currently ~25%) [Citation needed]
3. Early dismissal rate - those who are not allowed to finish the entire interview circuit

# How would we know that the process was fixed?
We want to:
1. Increase the (people who accept offers/people who get offers)
2. Increase the pass-through rate to ~60%
3. The early dismissal rate to ~15%. Meaning 85% of candidates make it through the day

# Who owns this process?
I propose __Team HR__ take own this process and take responsibility for the aforementioned metrics. We can support in the content of technical interviews, but the process itself needs to managed by them.
